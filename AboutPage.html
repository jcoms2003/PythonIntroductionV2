                    <p>
                        I am a beginner programmer who is passionate in sharing my knowledge and showcasing my performance when it comes to coding. 
                        I believe that everyone starts somewhere, even if it means starting with absolutely zero experience...
                        which would be me. None of my direct family has worked with programming before, so it took me a while to 
                        find it and figure out what it was. But, once I figured it out, I felt a strong desire to learn 
                        everything I can about it. Since then, I have been dabbling in multiple languages. My favorite language 
                        is Python (if you couldn't tell) which is a good beginner program in my opinion. Some other languages I 
                        have worked with include C, Arduino, HTML, and now CSS. I also have a passion for cyber security and am 
                        working towards some certificates at the moment. Eventually, I hope I'll eventually be able to work for a larger 
                        company as a programmer of some kind.
